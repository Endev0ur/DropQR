## 🧠 How It Works

This application allows users to securely share files using a QR code system. Here’s how it works, step-by-step:

---

### 1. 📤 File Upload
The user selects a file from their device using the upload interface.  
Supported formats include PDFs, images, documents, etc.

---

### 2. 🔐 (Optional) Encryption with Password
Before generating the QR code, the user can set a password to encrypt the file.  
This adds an extra layer of security during transfer.

---

### 3. 🔳 QR Code Generation
Once the file is ready, a QR code is generated that contains:
- A unique file access URL
This QR code is rendered live and can be scanned using any QR reader app or device.

---

### 4. 📲 Scanning & Download by Receiver
The receiver scans the QR code:
- They’re redirected to a secure download page.
- If the file was encrypted, they must enter the correct password.
- Otherwise, the file is available for instant download.

### 5. ⚡ Instant File Access
The file is securely served to the receiver for download.
